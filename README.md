This repository contains the Arduino codes and the python-based user interface compatible with the PhysicsLAB data acquisition system.
\
\
The Arduino-compatible boards are already programmed. Only upload a new Arduino code to them in case you need to make an update.
\
\
Please, use the python-based interface to facilitate the interaction with the PhysicsLAB system. A ready-to-use windows executable can be downloaded from:\
